In my senior year in high school, my AP U.S. Government class drafted the _Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act,_ a bipartisan bill which seeks justice for the victims of civil rights cold cases. The bill was fervently supported by Senators Doug Jones (D-AL) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), who campaigned in the Senate to pass the legislation. The Cold Case Act was passed near-unanimously through Congress, and [signed into law on Jan. 8, 2019](https://press.coldcaseact.com/cold-case-act-signed-into-law).

To support our media outreach efforts, I built a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered [press website](https://press.coldcaseact.com/), and developed content for the website such as press releases, graphics, and a “staff” directory layout. Using [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), I was able to track the performance of press releases and other content.

On the main [Cold Case Act](https://www.coldcaseact.com/) website, I helped to write content and used the [Congress Propublica API](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api) to build an [automatically refreshing](https://www.coldcaseact.com/#our-supporters) list of our cosponsors in Congress.
